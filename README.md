# Heart_Failure_Predicion
Web Application Using Django Framework For Heart Failure

I've worked on developing a predictive model for heart failure using machine learning tools which are based on algorithms â€“ sets of mathematical procedures which describe the relationships between variables , using also feature selection techniques like select k best where we choose those features in our data that contribute most to the target variable. In other words we choose the best predictors for the target variable.
Deploying my Machine learning model in to a website using Python Framework Django was really a good experience in order to discover new technologies and face new challenges .
